  <h2>Interview</h2>
  
    <p><b>Chloe:</b> First of all, what is your name, your connection to Ornithology, and tell me briefly about your passion for birds.</p>
    <p><b>Gabe:</b> My name is Gabriel Diggs, and I have been working towards becoming an ornithologist for many years. I've been birding for a very long time almost everywhere I go, and I often travel to my favorite spots for birding. Like all animals, I am very passionate about birds and I am very delighted to be in this meeting today!</p>
  
    <p><b>Chloe:</b> What can you tell me about birds and their symbolism? Do you think birds can represent more than just a scientific species (can they communicate ideas or themes about the world)?</p>
    <p><b>Gabe:</b> I can agree that many birds symbolize many things, and I think birds can be seen as more than just a random assortment of species. Most of all, I think all birds represent freedom.</p>
  
    <p><b>Chloe:</b> Tell me everything you know about doves, their scientific name/information, where they are usually found, their temperament, everything you may know.</p>
    <p><b>Gabe:</b> Doves are grouped with pigeons in the family Columbidae. Some species, mostly the smaller ones, are referred to as doves, while larger columbids are referred to as pigeons, but some use both interchangeably, like the feral pigeons everyone is familiar with, sometimes referred to as rock doves. Members of this family are found nearly all over the world—from forests to remote islands, to deserts, cities, and backyards. They are almost exclusively herbivorous, primarily eating seeds, fruits, and leaves. Many are strong, very fast fliers with large wings and stout, aerodynamic bodies. Something many have probably noticed is that during takeoff, air moving through the wings produces a whistling sound. Many members of the family are well known for their calls, which is a soft cooing. One of the most disappointing things about doves is that they build very flimsy nests. When raising young, they feed them a mixture of food from their crop called crop milk. Many species are also domesticated for food or as pets, such as ringneck doves or diamond doves.</p>
  
    <p><b>Chloe:</b> Why do you think doves as a species of bird are associated with peace and purity? Does this contrast their actual nature?</p>
    <p><b>Gabe:</b> In my opinion, I think doves are a symbol of peace because of their calm demeanor, their association with humans, and their gentle sounds and the bright colors of many species. I can confirm that this matches what doves are like in life.</p>
  
    <p><b>Chloe:</b> Tell me everything you know about hawks, their scientific name/information, where they are usually found, their temperament, everything you may know.</p>
    <p><b>Gabe:</b> Hawks belong to the family Accipitridae. Like doves, there are many genera, but the three I am most familiar with are the buzzards, the sparrowhawks in the Accipiter genus, and the relatively new genus, Astur, which has recently been assigned to goshawks. As one might expect, hawks are hypercarnivores and are found nearly all over the world in many habitats, from open plains to deserts and forests, and many live in residential areas.</p>
  
    <p><b>Chloe:</b> Why do you think hawks as a species of bird are associated with war and violence?</p>
    <p><b>Gabe:</b> Like with eagles, I've always seen hawks as symbols of power and independence. My guess as to why they are associated with war and violence is because of their well-known fierce impression and violent attacks on prey, as well as their longtime use as hunting companions by falconers.</p>

    <p><b>Chloe:</b> Tell me everything you know about crows, their scientific name/information, where they are usually found, their temperament, everything you may know.</p>
    <p><b>Gabe:</b> Crows belong to the genus Corvus. Like doves and pigeons, there are no specific taxonomic differences between crows and ravens, as all are in the same genus. Some, mostly smaller species, are referred to as crows, and larger birds as ravens. This genus is found in almost every temperate continent and habitat, and many thrive around human settlements. Crows are slow but agile in the air, while ravens are more so and often soar similarly to hawks. Crows are famously very intelligent and have unique personalities. I'm sure many people have heard stories about them solving puzzles, bringing gifts, or mourning dead individuals. At the same time, in my experience, crows are very skittish and will flee from a far distance, but some, like the ones at my school, will occasionally let me feed them.</p>
  
    <p><b>Chloe:</b> Why do you think crows as a species of bird are associated with death and darkness?</p>
    <p><b>Gabe:</b> I see crows as bright, funny, and active creatures, but I think they are associated with death and darkness due to the harsh, grating calls of many species and their presence around dead animals or garbage. It's a well-known fact that a group of crows is called a "murder," which I also think contributes to their reputation.</p>
  
    <p><b>Chloe:</b> If you had to describe the relationship between pigeons, hawks, and crows, what would it be? Are they seen interacting in nature, or are they less likely to interact?</p>
    <p><b>Gabe:</b> There's quite a relationship between these three birds. I've seen crows and rock doves feeding together in urban places, but they would otherwise ignore each other. As for crows and hawks, that is a completely different story. Hawks will sometimes prey on crows, and in return, crows will gather in groups to chase away hawks—it’s loud and hard for anyone to miss! And, of course, hawks and doves have a predator-prey relationship. In my yard, it seems doves are the preferred food for Cooper’s hawks that stop by my feeders.</p>
  
    <p><b>Chloe:</b> Thank you for your time!</p>
