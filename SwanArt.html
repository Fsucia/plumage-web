            Le Cygne has been inspiring artists and writers for centuries, with
            each generation and movement creating their own rendition of the symbolic
            bird. Within the western art world, the scenes and iconography inspired by
            the story of Leda and the Swan, a story in Ovid’s Metamorphoses, have
            been reimagined over and over again, becoming almost a thematic right of
            passage for an artist’s portfolio. The story is that of Leda, a spartan queen,
            who was raped (or seduced) by Zeus in the form of a swan. Countless
            paintings, sculptures, etchings, and more have been inspired by the story.
            It became an icon of classicism during the Renaissance, becoming more
            important for the educated class than it had been for the society in which
            the myth originated.

            The Italian Renaissance saw tons of renditions of Leda and
            the Swan, with each school of painting copying each other and using
            the composition and subject matter to hone their skills. Some famous
            explorations of the story are Raphael’s Leda and the Swan (above) and
            Leonardo da Vinci’s Leda and the Swan (below), both of which were
            influenced the painters across Europe. The story was used by painters
            to explore themes of sexuality and the female form in a context that was
            considered acceptable, since it was classical subject matter. However, it
            also dealt with the complicated theme of rape, allowing for many artists to
            interpret the story and compositions in different lights.

            The French painter, Paul Cezanne, completed his
            version of Leda and the Swan, showing both traditional
            and new stylizations. His version, seen above, is palpably
            sexual. Leda gazes directly at the swan with unflinching
            and seductive eye contact, unlike DaVinci’s Leda who is not
            gazing at the swan that is encircling her. Instead she gazes
            upon her children at her feet. These renaissance renditions
            of Leda and the Swan are using the motherly qualities to
            negate the otherwise sensual nature of the full frontal nudity.
            However, 300 and some years later, Cezanne does not shy
            away from painting Leda in a sensual way. This Leda is
            displaying herself for the viewer, posed more like a reclining
            Venus painting than a Leda painting. No children are
            present in this painting – Leda remains “available”, remains
            a young girl. Cezanne even sketched in a champagne flute
            in her hand in an early preparatory sketch.

            While Leda is overtly sexualized in this painting,
            there is also a layer of awkwardness in the composition.
            The swan, as in the paintings that came before it, is
            possessive of Leda. But in this version, instead of an
            embrace, he is shown more in aggression. Swans are
            known to be aggressive when need be, and the bite on the
            hand and wings raised in flight could be read as an attack
            even though Cezanne softened the motions and painted in
            a muted, light hearted color palette. In this reading of the
            painting, Leda’s stare becomes more ambiguous. A stare of
            contempt? A stare of annoyance? A stare of lust, of love?
            Because of these ambiguities and stylistic
            changes from the past, Cezanne’s Leda and the Swan
            is a fascinating contribution to the world’s continuous
            reimagining of the classical myth. Leda’s story is one that
            will never go out of style.
