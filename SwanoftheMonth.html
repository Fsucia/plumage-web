      <h1 class="section-title">Overview</h1>
      <p class="article-para">
        Swans are large waterfowl known for their elegance, graceful movements, and striking appearance. With long,
        S-shaped necks and large bodies, they have captivated the human imagination for centuries, often symbolizing love, beauty, and fidelity. Swans can be seen in both white and black plumage, depending on the species. There are several species
        of swans, each with unique characteristics and habitats.

    <section>
      <h1 class="section-title">Habitat</h1>
      <p class="article-para">
        Swans typically inhabit lowland freshwater wetlands, including marshes, lagoons, lakes, ponds, and slow-moving
        rivers. They are often found in man-made bodies of water like reservoirs. Some species, such as the Mute Swan, are also
        comfortable in brackish or saltwater environments. Swans are distributed across the globe, with Northern Hemisphere species like the Mute, Trumpeter, and Whooper Swans, while species such as the Black Swan and Coscoroba Swan are native
        to the Southern Hemisphere, particularly Australia and South America.

      <h1 class="section-title">Migration</h1>
      <p class="article-para">
        Swans are migratory birds, traveling long distances during the winter months (September to October). They typically
        fly in flocks of 20 to 30, sometimes more, and form a V-shaped formation, with the leader at the front. When the leader gets
        tired, another swan takes its place. This formation helps with communication and efficiency during migration. Unlike geese,
        who tend to follow coastlines and stop at various points along their route, swans prefer to fly straight to their destination
        unless forced to stop by weather.

    <section>
      <h1 class="section-title">Endangered Status</h1>
      <p class="article-para">
        Swans are not considered endangered. All swan species are classified as “Least Concern” by the International
        Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), indicating stable or increasing populations.

      <h1 class="section-title">Diet</h1>
      <p class="article-para">
        Swans are mostly herbivores, feeding on aquatic vegetation like pondweeds, algae, and widgeon grass. They may
        occasionally consume small insects or tadpoles. Their serrated bills are designed for grasping plants, and they can sometimes catch small fish, mollusks, or worms.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h1 class="section-title">Behavior</h1>
      <p class="article-para">
        Swans are known for their strong family bonds. They mate for life, and males play an active role in nest building and
        incubation. They also perform elaborate courtship dances as part of their mating ritual. Swans typically lay between 3 and
        8 eggs per breeding season. Due to their strong protective instincts, they are very territorial, especially during the breeding
        season.

    <section>
      <h1 class="section-title">Fun Fact</h1>
      <p class="article-para">
        While swans from the Northern Hemisphere are typically all white, species from the Southern Hemisphere, like the
        Black Swan, have black feathers with white markings. Swans have also been introduced to North America, particularly Mute
        Swans, which were brought in the late 1800s and early 1900s for ornamental purposes in parks and ponds. Some of these
        swans escaped and established the wild populations we have today.
