                        aspects of my
                        life."</i></h3>
                <h6><br>How would you introduce yourself and what you do in life?</h6>
                <p>I’m the bird man! This may be a slight overstatement, but I do find myself occasionally giving myself
                    that
                    title in conversation as birds are my profession, hobby, family, and pretty much all aspects of my
                    life.
                    More technically, I am the Senior Director of Programs at Birds Georgia. I oversee a skilled team of
                    people
                    who are working hard at building places where birds and people thrive through conservational
                    activities,
                    educational programs, and community engagement projects. This ranges from international birdwatching
                    travel
                    to prescribed burning to improve habitat to programs at elementary schools across the state. Away
                    from work,
                    I like to spend time outside with the birds, traveling near and far with my wife and daughter,
                    eating
                    diverse and delicious food, and watching probably too much TV and movies. </p>
                <h6><br>We are creating an online magazine, Plumage, focusing on birds in the arts and media, but also
                    in nature
                    and in Atlanta. Our first magazine issue focuses on swans. Could you tell us about the swan species
                    found in
                    the United States, and specifically in Georgia? </h6>
                <p>Swans are an interesting group of birds to think about in a US or Georgia perspective. We technically
                    have
                    two native species in the United States: the Tundra Swan and the Trumpeter Swan, as well as the
                    Whooper
                    Swan, which is native to Asia and Europe but is very rarely encountered in Alaska and other coastal
                    areas.
                    What makes this group of birds so interesting is that there are many species that are domesticated
                    and found
                    in private collections or at community parks. The most well-known of these is the Mute Swan. Mute
                    Swans are
                    probably what people imagine when they think of a swan, but they are actually native to Europe and
                    not the
                    US. Enough individuals of this species have escaped domestication that in parts of the US (the
                    Midwest, for
                    example), birding rules allow one to count them as a feral population. Georgia isn’t a hotbed for
                    swan
                    activity. We are too far south to get Tundra or Trumpeter Swans regularly, though small numbers (a
                    handful
                    of birds) of presumed wild swans show up most years. The biggest challenge is determining whether
                    these
                    birds are wild migrants or simply escaped pets. Many sites across the state have domesticated swans,
                    primarily Mute Swans, but also Tundras and Trumpeters.</p>
                <h6><br>Can you share some insights into swans' behavior in the wild? </h6>
                <p>Swans are elegant birds, very large (the largest waterfowl in our region), stunning when seen in the
                    wild,
                    and they often elicit feelings of cold weather and of sparsely inhabited lands. Swans around the
                    world are
                    typically found in temperate habitats, often in colder areas near either pole. During the breeding
                    season,
                    pairs nest on the edges of marshes and wetlands. They are fierce defenders of their young, which can
                    often
                    be a problem for an unsuspecting kayaker getting too close for comfort. Away from the breeding
                    season, most
                    individuals migrate south once their home bodies of water freeze. They often form large flocks of
                    trumpeting
                    birds and occasionally gather together on winter wetlands or even out in plowed farm fields. Swans
                    fit into
                    the dabbling category of waterfowl, dipping just their upper parts underwater when they are looking
                    for
                    vegetation to feast upon.  </p>
                <h6><br>What are the biggest conservation challenges facing swan populations in Georgia or the broader
                    region? 
                </h6>
                <p>Swans, like most birds, are challenged most by habitat loss. Trumpeter Swans used to be quite low in
                    numbers
                    but have rebounded greatly over the past 90 years. They typically do not do well around human
                    disturbance so
                    as we continue to develop more and more land in Georgia and the United States, that could negatively
                    impact
                    swan population. In the past, overhunting was an issue but today, both native species are doing well
                    enough
                    that regulated hunting seasons are allowed. Lead poisoning, collisions with structure/wires, and
                    changes to
                    their habitats (invasive species, climate, etc.) also may impact numbers negatively. </p>
                <h6><br>What is your stance on how human activities, like habitat encroachment or feeding swans in
                    parks, impact
                    their well-being? </h6>
                <p>For wild swans, human activities typically result in generally a negative interaction. Fortunately,
                    most of
                    these breeding swans are far from a lot of people. In more urban environments, where swans are fed
                    or in
                    close proximity to boaters or people fishing, the birds are more accustomed to human behavior. Even
                    for
                    these semi-domestic birds, encroachment can be too much and endanger both the bird and the person.
                    On rare
                    occasions, swans go to protect themselves or their young from people and the end result is an
                    injured person
                    who met the end of wing smack! In addition to scaring the bird or risking the health of the
                    bird/person, a
                    lot of feeding of swans and other waterfowl is done using poor food options. Bread for example is
                    not good
                    for any waterfowl species and can have physical impacts and developmental issues. In general, if
                    swans that
                    are close to humans are given space and not fed, or fed only a healthy pellet of food, things should
                    be fine
                    for their well-being. </p>

                <h6><br>Can we say that swans are indicators of healthy ecosystems? Could you elaborate on how their
                    presence
                    (or absence) signals environmental changes? </h6>
                <p>I do think swans can be used as indicators for the ecosystem. First, climate change and warmer
                    temperatures
                    can potentially have a large impact on swans. It could inhibit their breeding success. Warmer
                    winters could
                    impact their migration strategies or lead to birds selecting less than ideal overwintering
                    locations. Swans
                    dipping in number could indicate issues with our wetlands and the health of the broader northern
                    forests
                    which are vital to so many migratory bird species. If swan numbers stay stable or increase, I think
                    we can
                    take that as a good sign for the water-based ecosystems in the northern parts of our country. Birds
                    no
                    longer showing up at focal wintering locations or numbers trending down more generally could
                    indicate
                    climate issues or other large-scale issues.  </p>
                <h6><br>As a conservationist, how do you view the intersection of science and art in raising awareness
                    about
                    bird conservation? </h6>
                <p>I think it is so vital. In my opinion, many ornithologists or research institutions are doing
                    incredible
                    science but often fail in telling the story. At Birds Georgia, we are always trying to think of new
                    and
                    creative ways to tell the story of our birds, to engage new audiences, and show people why birds
                    matter. Art
                    can be such a creative and useful for conservation messaging to be communicated.  </p>
                <h6><br>Migration is a key aspect of many bird species. Do swans migrate? If yes, how do swans navigate
                    their
                    migration paths, and what are some of the risks they face along the way?</h6>
                <p>The majority of swans do migrate though some populations are resident. Most birds use a mix of tools
                    and
                    beacons to complete their migrations. They use physical cues (lakes, mountains), the setting sun and
                    stars
                    (many birds migrate at night), the earth's magnetic field, the sound of water once they get closer,
                    verbal
                    cues from other flock makes, and other landscape features. Migration is simply amazing! Swans in
                    migration
                    risk hunting (outside of permitted seasons), collisions with electrical wires or other structures in
                    the
                    built environment, habitat loss, land conversation, and a changing climate making it more
                    challenging for
                    birds to know when to go and what the conditions will be when they arrive. Many birds use day length
                    and not
                    immediate surroundings to drive their decision to migrate. Less reliability in our climate is posing
                    a
                    threat to our migratory birds.  </p>
                <h6><br>How does Birds Georgia involve the public in swan and bird conservation? Are there any programs
                    or
                    events coming up that you’re particularly excited about? </h6>
                <p>We currently do not have any specific swan/waterfowl-based programming. However, swans do fit into a
                    lot of
                    our conservation activities and there are ways for community members to participate. First, document
                    your
                    sighting of swans. This is probably most helpful when done using eBird but even things like
                    iNaturalist are
                    useful for bird presence/absence. Birds Georgia does a lot of habitat restoration and always needs
                    volunteers to help with these projects. Our restoration sites are not likely to be too appealing to
                    a
                    migratory swan, but they could be, and they are making our broader ecosystems more robust and
                    healthier
                    which benefits all birds/wildlife. Swans are occasionally spotted on some of our birding field trips
                    and
                    travel opportunities. By taking part in these, you can learn more about Birds Georgia, our community
                    of
                    members and bird lovers, the birds themselves, and how one can help conserve them. </p>
                <h6><br>As someone deeply immersed in bird conservation, do you have a favorite personal memory or
                    encounter
                    with swans you'd like to share? </h6>
                <p>Yes! I lived in Indiana prior to Georgia and near where I lived, we would get large groups of swans
                    in the
                    winter. I had not seen a Trumpeter Swan prior to living in Indiana and I still recall seeing my
                    first group
                    of them, probably 50 mixed in with hundreds of Tundra Swans, out on a partially frozen pond. I
                    remember
                    being so excited not only for the new bird on my list but also because they have been such a
                    conservation
                    success. I felt very fortunate to see this species, in numbers, when they were much much rarer not
                    that long
                    ago. Their loud calls seemed extra piercing on that frigid Indiana morning near the town of
                    Universal. </p>

                    <p class="article-para">
                        I’m the bird man! This may be a slight overstatement, but I do find myself occasionally giving
                        myself that title in conversation as birds are my profession, hobby, family, and pretty much all
                        aspects of my life. More technically, I am the Senior Director of Programs at Birds Georgia. I
                        oversee a skilled team of people who are working hard at building places where birds and people
                        thrive through conservation activities, educational programs, and community engagement projects.
                        This ranges from international birdwatching travel to prescribed burning to improve habitat to
                        programs at elementary schools across the state. Away from work, I like to spend time outside
                        with the birds, traveling near and far with my wife and daughter, eating diverse and delicious
                        food, and watching probably too much TV and movies.

                    <h6><br>We are creating an online magazine, Plumage, focusing on birds in the arts and media, but
                        also in nature and in Atlanta. Our first magazine issue focuses on swans. Could you tell us
                        about the swan species found in the United States, and specifically in Georgia?</h6>
                    <p class="article-para">
                        Swans are an interesting group of birds to think about in a US or Georgia perspective. We
                        technically have two native species in the United States: the Tundra Swan and the Trumpeter
                        Swan, as well as the Whooper Swan, which is native to Asia and Europe but is very rarely
                        encountered in Alaska and other coastal areas. What makes this group of birds so interesting is
                        that there are many species that are domesticated and found in private collections or at
                        community parks. The most well-known of these is the Mute Swan. Mute Swans are probably what
                        people imagine when they think of a swan, but they are actually native to Europe and not the US.
                        Enough individuals of this species have escaped domestication that in parts of the US (the
                        Midwest, for example), birding rules allow one to count them as a feral population. Georgia
                        isn’t a hotbed for swan activity. We are too far south to get Tundra or Trumpeter Swans
                        regularly, though small numbers (a handful of birds) of presumed wild swans show up most years.
                        The biggest challenge is determining whether these birds are wild migrants or simply escaped
                        pets. Many sites across the state have domesticated swans, primarily Mute Swans, but also
                        Tundras and Trumpeters.

                    <h6><br>Can you share some insights into swans' behavior in the wild?</h6>
                    <p class="article-para">
                        Swans are elegant birds, very large (the largest waterfowl in our region), stunning when seen in
                        the wild, and they often elicit feelings of cold weather and of sparsely inhabited lands. Swans
                        around the world are typically found in temperate habitats, often in colder areas near either
                        pole. During the breeding season, pairs nest on the edges of marshes and wetlands. They are
                        fierce defenders of their young, which can often be a problem for an unsuspecting kayaker
                        getting too close for comfort. Away from the breeding season, most individuals migrate south
                        once their home bodies of water freeze. They often form large flocks of trumpeting birds and
                        occasionally gather together on winter wetlands or even out in plowed farm fields. Swans fit
                        into the dabbling category of waterfowl, dipping just their upper parts underwater when they are
                        looking for vegetation to feast upon.
                    </p>

                    <h6><br>What are the biggest conservation challenges facing swan populations in Georgia or the
                        broader region?</h6>
                    <p class="article-para">
                        Swans, like most birds, are challenged most by habitat loss. Trumpeter Swans used to be quite
                        low in numbers but have rebounded greatly over the past 90 years. They typically do not do well
                        around human disturbance so as we continue to develop more and more land in Georgia and the
                        United States, that could negatively impact swan population. In the past, overhunting was an
                        issue but today, both native species are doing well enough that regulated hunting seasons are
                        allowed. Lead poisoning, collisions with structure/wires, and changes to their habitats
                        (invasive species, climate, etc.) also may impact numbers negatively.
                    </p>

                    <h6>What is your stance on how human activities, like habitat encroachment or feeding swans in
                        parks, impact their well-being?</h6>
                    <p class="article-para">
                        For wild swans, human activities typically result in generally a negative interaction.
                        Fortunately, most of these breeding swans are far from a lot of people. In more urban
                        environments, where swans are fed or in close proximity to boaters or people fishing, the birds
                        are more accustomed to human behavior. Even for these semi-domestic birds, encroachment can be
                        too much and endanger both the bird and the person. On rare occasions, swans go to protect
                        themselves or their young from people and the end result is an injured person who met the end of
                        wing smack! In addition to scaring the bird or risking the health of the bird/person, a lot of
                        feeding of swans and other waterfowl is done using poor food options. Bread for example is not
                        good for any waterfowl species and can have physical impacts and developmental issues. In
                        general, if swans that are close to humans are given space and not fed, or fed only a healthy
                        pellet of food, things should be fine for their well-being.

            <h6><br>Can we say that swans are indicators of healthy ecosystems? Could you elaborate on how their
                presence (or absence) signals environmental changes?</h6>
            <p class="article-para">
                I do think swans can be used as indicators for the ecosystem. First, climate change and warmer
                temperatures can potentially have a large impact on swans. It could inhibit their breeding success.
                Warmer winters could impact their migration strategies or lead to birds selecting less than ideal
                overwintering locations. Swans dipping in number could indicate issues with our wetlands and the health
                of the broader northern forests which are vital to so many migratory bird species. If swan numbers stay
                stable or increase, I think we can take that as a good sign for the water-based ecosystems in the
                northern parts of our country. Birds no longer showing up at focal wintering locations or numbers
                trending down more generally could indicate climate issues or other large-scale issues.
            </p>

            <h6><br>As a conservationist, how do you view the intersection of science and art in raising awareness about
                bird conservation?</h6>
            <p class="article-para">
                I think it is so vital. In my opinion, many ornithologists or research institutions are doing incredible
                science but often fail in telling the story. At Birds Georgia, we are always trying to think of new and
                creative ways to tell the story of our birds, to engage new audiences, and show people why birds matter.
                Art can be such a creative and useful for conservation messaging to be communicated.
            </p>

            <h6><br>Migration is a key aspect of many bird species. Do swans migrate? If yes, how do swans navigate
                their migration paths, and what are some of the risks they face along the way?</h6>
            <p class="article-para">
                The majority of swans do migrate though some populations are resident. Most birds use a mix of tools and
                beacons to complete their migrations. They use physical cues (lakes, mountains), the setting sun and
                stars (many birds migrate at night), the earth's magnetic field, the sound of water once they get
                closer, verbal cues from other flockmates, and other landscape features. Migration is simply amazing!
                Swans in migration risk hunting (outside of permitted seasons), collisions with electrical wires or
                other structures in the built environment, habitat loss, land conversion, and a changing climate making
                it more challenging for birds to know when to go and what the conditions will be when they arrive. Many
                birds use day length and not immediate surroundings to drive their decision to migrate. Less reliability
                in our climate is posing a threat to our migratory birds.
            </p>

            <h6><br>How does Birds Georgia involve the public in swan and bird conservation? Are there any programs or
                events coming up that you’re particularly excited about?</h6>
            <p class="article-para">
                We currently do not have any specific swan/waterfowl-based programming. However, swans do fit into a lot
                of our conservation activities and there are ways for community members to participate. First, document
                your sighting of swans. This is probably most helpful when done using eBird but even things like
                iNaturalist are useful for bird presence/absence. Birds Georgia does a lot of habitat restoration and
                always needs volunteers to help with these projects. Our restoration sites are not likely to be too
                appealing to a migratory swan, but they could be, and they are making our broader ecosystems more robust
                and healthier which benefits all birds/wildlife. Swans are occasionally spotted on some of our birding
                field trips and travel opportunities. By taking part in these, you can learn more about Birds Georgia,
                our community of members and bird lovers, the birds themselves, and how one can help conserve them.
            </p>

            <h6><br>As someone deeply immersed in bird conservation, do you have a favorite personal memory or encounter
                with swans you'd like to share?</h6>
            <p class="article-para">
                Yes! I lived in Indiana prior to Georgia and near where I lived, we would get large groups of swans in
                the winter. I had not seen a Trumpeter Swan prior to living in Indiana and I still recall seeing my
                first group of them, probably 50 mixed in with hundreds of Tundra Swans, out on a partially frozen pond.
                I remember being so excited not only for the new bird on my list but also because they have been such a
                conservation success. I felt very fortunate to see this species, in numbers, when they were much much
                rarer not that long ago. Their loud calls seemed extra piercing on that frigid Indiana morning near the
                town of Universal.
